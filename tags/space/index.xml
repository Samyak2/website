He says that at a minimum, megatons of equipment and other resources have to be put in orbit &lt;em>every year&lt;/em>.
For reference, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Saturn V&lt;/a> (the launch vehicle used to send humans to the moon),
can take a payload of around 140 tons to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit">Low Earth Orbit&lt;/a>.
A launch of Saturn V costs $1.23 billion (in 2019 value). To reach the goal of a megaton per year there would have to be more than
7000 launches per year, or 20 launches per day! That would cost $8.8 trillion(!).
But of course, technology has come a long way since 1969.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
