Well, I have. In its ideal form, this is what pair/mob programming would do â€” the navigator(s) simply think about and express their idea of what needs to happen and the driver magically gets it done. In the real world though, this does not happen.</description></item><item><title>Hello there!</title><link>https://samyak.me/post/first/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 23:36:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://samyak.me/post/first/</guid><description>Welcome to my blog</description></item><item><title>On water and systems</title><link>https://samyak.me/post/water-docker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samyak.me/post/water-docker/</guid><description>or how docker is a plumbing system</description></item><item><title>Solving A Git Murder Mystery</title><link>https://samyak.me/post/gitstery/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samyak.me/post/gitstery/</guid><description>gitstery is a murder mystery game entirely contained in a git repo!</description></item><item><title>My old games</title><link>https://samyak.me/post/my-old-games/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samyak.me/post/my-old-games/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I was in school, about 6-7 years ago, I had found a new hobby and passion - making games.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how but I found a free 3D game maker named &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150514120532/http://www.3drad.com/">&lt;strong>3D Rad&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.
I played around a lot with it on my ancient PC, which had a Pentium 4 and 1 Gigabyte of RAM.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiplanetary civilisation?</title><link>https://samyak.me/post/multiplanetary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samyak.me/post/multiplanetary/</guid><description>Elon Musk recently tweeted about the logistics requirements for a Multiplanetary civilisation. He says that at a minimum, megatons of equipment and other resources have to be put in orbit every year. For reference, a Saturn V (the launch vehicle used to send humans to the moon), can take a payload of around 140 tons to Low Earth Orbit. A launch of Saturn V costs $1.23 billion (in 2019 value). To reach the goal of a megaton per year there would have to be more than 7000 launches per year, or 20 launches per day!</description></item></channel></rss>
