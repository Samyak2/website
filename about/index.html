<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Samyak Sarnayak, a final year student at PES University and upcoming software engineer at <a href=https://chaosgenius.io/>Chaos Genius</a>.</p>
<p>My current, and newfound, interest is in the field of programming languages and compiler design. Though I&rsquo;m always open to learn something new in the broader field of systems programming, especially if it relates to performance optimizations, parallelism, containers or distributed systems.</p>
<p>Most of my projects are open source on <a href=https://github.com/Samyak2/>my GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id=more-about-me>More about me</h3>
<p>My journey with computers started when I was a kid, probably 7-8 years old, with making animations in PowerPoint. These animations were <em>point</em>less <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, but I had fun and that&rsquo;s all that mattered.
A few years later, when I was 11-12 years old, I discovered <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20150514120532/http://www.3drad.com/>3DRAD</a> - a 3D game maker. It barely ran on our PC at the time, but over the years I <a href=/post/my-old-games/>made quite a few games</a> using it. 3DRAD introduced me to my first real programming language - <a href=https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/>AngelScript</a> that had a syntax similar to C/C++. It was also the first time I had to make sense of a <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20150508094348/http://3drad.com/Script_reference.htm>library reference documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The next language I came across was Java. It was mandated by school and so it wasn&rsquo;t as fun, although I still played around with it. The next couple of years I did not do much programming, though I did participate in Google Code-In.</p>
<p>University was the place where I levelled up the most. I first learnt Python there and even though I have used it for a few years now, even to this day I find something new in it constantly. The next language I was introduced to was C. My knowledge of C is mostly surface level as I never used it as much as other languages. Then there was the usual CS curriculum <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> of data structures, algorithms, discrete math, digital design, automata theory, etc. Outside of those, I worked on quite a few random projects and participated in many hackathons (you can find most of them in my GitHub history).</p>
<p>For a considerable amount of time, I was into machine learning and, more specifically, deep learning. From taking external courses and reading research papers to writing papers <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> and implementing <sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> some things. Eventually I wasn&rsquo;t as interested in it. There were a lot of reasons for it <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> and I don&rsquo;t want to give this paragraph more space than this.</p>
<p>Some time in my second year, I found the Julia programming language. I was really invested in it for some time, but I slowly realized that it&rsquo;s not my kind of language. At the time I wasn&rsquo;t sure why I decided to learn a language out of nowhere. Now I think it&rsquo;s because I want to discover and learn new languages to see the limits of what is possible with programming languages. Naturally this lead to an interest in compiler design and the course on it really helped make this stronger. As of writing this, I&rsquo;m pretty new to this field but I hope to discover, learn and create a lot more.</p>
<p>In August 2019, I joined <a href=https://github.com/pesos/>PES Open Source</a> <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>. I met a lot of great people there and learnt a lot - about open source and beyond. I&rsquo;m not sure why I joined PESOS as a core member then (it was a really good decision though!), because my first real open source contribution was at least a month after that <sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>, sometime before Hacktoberfest that year. At PESOS, I started an open source project that I was serious about - <a href=https://github.com/browser-history/browser-history>browser-history</a>. The goal was to help people get started with contributing to open source projects, using a real project that we could help first timers with. We have had over 25 contributors (some first timers) from India, Kenya, Germany, UK, Belgium and others <sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup>. <code>browser-history</code> also participated in PyCon India 2020 DevSprints and was invited again the next year - helping a few people make their first open source contribution.</p>
<p>My time in university was abound with internships too. The first one started in November of 2019 at <a href=https://www.deeplogick.com/>Deeplogick</a>. I was skeptical at first, considering that I found their &ldquo;job posting&rdquo; through a WhatsApp forward. I was very nervous while I gave my very first interview, which lasted a couple of hours. They were impressed by my GitHub profile and I eventually got selected. It was a very early stage startup with only a couple of other people working on the tech side of things, but there was some good work being done. It was a fun and busy few months until the pandemic made it hard to find and talk to customers and the company had to stop operations. The next place I worked for was <a href=https://www.rulezero.com/>RuleZero</a> - another early stage, but fast growing, startup. After that came the time of campus placements and I secured a two-month summer internship at <a href=https://www.akamai.com/>Akamai</a>. Through a contact from one of my previous internships, I was introduced to <a href=https://www.chaosgenius.io/>Chaos Genius</a> - another early stage startup. I&rsquo;m currently an intern there and will be joining as a full-time software engineer from July 2022.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at right now. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll next update this page, but I hope to learn a lot more and generally be a better version of myself the next time.</p>

<p>Though I did pick up a few things from these courses, I was mostly very bored in classes.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I call them &ldquo;papers&rdquo; and not &ldquo;research papers&rdquo; because they had no research in them :)&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a fun one: <a href=https://fashion.samyaks.xyz/>https://fashion.samyaks.xyz/</a> (works entirely client side on a static site).&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id=fn:5 role=doc-endnote>
<p>The uni&rsquo;s course on this subject did not help at all in maintaining that interest :)&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>PESOS now continues to live in a different form at <a href=https://unifoss.github.io/>UniFOSS</a>. Join us if you too are an Indian university student interested in FOSS. Also, <a href=https://atharvaraykar.me/education/building-a-community.html>here</a> is a great summary of what went down at PESOS, written by the person who (re-)started it.&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><a href=https://github.com/adblockradio/adblockradio/pull/13>This</a> was my first external (to a repo not belonging to me or my friends) PR. It was merged two years later. <a href=https://github.com/bsoyka/mystery-egg/pull/31>This one</a> was my first useful, external PR.&#160;<a href=#fnref:7 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id=fn:8 role=doc-endnote>
<p>Hacktoberfest (2020 and 2021) helped significantly in bringing these contributors (especially the ones outside PES).&#160;<a href=#fnref:8 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
