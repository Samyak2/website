# Samyak's website

The code for my personal website. Warning: very chaotic, this was only made public to make use of GitHub pages.

## Usage/Contributing

Start a local dev server:
```bash
hugo server --buildDrafts
```

Make a new blog post (replace XX and filename):
```bash
hugo new content/post/XX_filename.md
```

## Made using

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [My fork of Abraham Raji's gruvhugo theme](https://github.com/Samyak2/gruvhugo/tree/samyak) (readme, docs, images, etc. may not be updated with the changes in my fork). If you like the layout and want something similar for your own website, this is where you should start.
