This short post describes my experiences and thoughts on it.
Why Cloudflare? # We were moving our static sites away from Netlify anyway and it did not make sense to keep it just for the basic DNS it provides.
Also because Cloudflare provides an easy to set up CDN and a reverse proxy.
Why not Route53?</description></item></channel></rss>
